                        the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying
                        any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your
                        personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably
                        believe there is a prospect of litigation in connection with which the personal data

                    <p>Under certain circumstances, you may have the following rights under data protection
                        laws in relation to your personal data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access</strong> – the right to request confirmation of whether we
                            process personal data relating to you and, if so, to request a copy of that
                            personal data.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Correction</strong> – the right to request that we rectify or update
                            your personal data that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated.

                        <li><strong>Erasure</strong> – the right to request that we erase your personal data
                            in certain circumstances, such as where we collected personal data on the basis
                            of your consent and you withdraw your consent.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Restriction of processing</strong> – the right to request that we
                            restrict the use of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as while
                            we consider another request that you have submitted, for example, a request that
                            we update your personal data.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> – where our processing of your personal data
                            is based on your consent, the right to withdraw your consent; however withdrawal
                            of consent (i) does not invalidate the consent-based processing that occurred
                            prior to such withdrawal, or processing that is not based on consent, and (ii)
                            means that we will no longer be able to perform such consent-based processing
                            activities, which may result in us being unable to provide certain services to
                            you.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Portability</strong> – the right to request a copy of your personal data
                            that we process in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and
                            to have that data transmitted to an alternative data controller.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Objection to processing</strong> – the right to object to certain data
                            processing, such as for direct marketing purposes or where we rely on legitimate
                            interests to which you object based on your particular circumstances.
                        </li>
