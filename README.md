### Stack
We mostly use React+Mobx.<br>
Also OIDC, Formik, i18next presented.

You can use component state for view-state variables.<br>
All persistent values should be stored in mobx stores.<br>
Most of stores are automatic cached, also forms are cached, use CachedForm.<br>
Don't write any complex logic into stores.<br>
All LTR to RTL transitions are automatic, but always keep internationalization in mind.<br> 
Avoid to inline css, neither use BEM â€” respect others.<br><br>
